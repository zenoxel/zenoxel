About
-----
I'm a software engineer who loves solving real problems with clean, pragmatic code. I enjoy building open-source tools, shipping production-ready systems, and learning new technologies that help teams move faster.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a high-performance service for [Project Name](https://github.com/your/project)
- 🌱 I’m learning: [New Tech / Language]
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on: developer tooling, infra automation, and UX-focused frontend work
- 💬 Ask me about: system design, testing strategies, and developer experience
- ⚡ Fun fact: I collect (or build) tiny automation scripts that save me hours each month

Areas of expertise
------------------
- Languages: JavaScript / TypeScript • Python • Go • Rust (or replace with your stack)
- Backend: Microservices, REST & GraphQL APIs, gRPC, event-driven architectures
- Frontend: React, Next.js, component-driven design
- DevOps: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- Testing & Quality: unit/integration tests, TDD, observability

What I build
------------
Here are a few types of projects I enjoy building:

- Developer tooling (CLI utilities, dev servers, linting/formatting helpers)
- Scalable APIs and realtime systems
- Web apps with great DX and accessibility
- Open-source libraries that save dev time
