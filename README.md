## Overview

I build software systems that are expected to **work**,  
continue to **work under load**,  
and **fail in predictable ways** when things inevitably go wrong.

My day-to-day involves backend engineering, AI/LLM system integration,
and Linux-based environments — plus a healthy amount of staring at metrics
wondering *“why is latency like this?”*

---

## What I Actually Do

- Design backend & distributed systems that survive real traffic
- Integrate AI / LLMs and **measure** whether they are worth the cost
- Live in Linux terminals more than any GUI
- Tune performance, add observability, remove unnecessary complexity
- Automate everything that looks like it might annoy me twice

## Technical Profile

| Field | Value |
|------|------|
| **Role** | Software Engineer |
| **Domains** | Backend Systems · AI Systems · Linux |
| **Stack Preference** | Strongly-typed, performance-oriented |
| **OS of Choice** | Linux (obviously) |
| **Engineering Loop** | Measure → Optimize → Simplify → Repeat |

---

## Current Focus

Currently spending most of my energy on:

- Building scalable backend components that behave in production
- Evaluating AI model outputs, latency, and cost (numbers > vibes)
- Improving reliability, observability, and operational sanity

---

## Engineering Beliefs (Hard-Earned)

- Clarity beats cleverness
- Systems matter more than features
- If you didn’t measure it, you didn’t optimize it
- Automation is cheaper than human patience
- Documentation is not optional — it’s part of the product

## GitHub Activity

This profile is intentionally kept minimal.  
If something here exists, it probably solves a real problem  
(or existed because I was annoyed enough to write code).
